Task: Implement a function parse_manga_info(node) that accepts a single parameter node of type selectolax.parsers.Node. The function should parse the given node representing this manga page: "{link}" to extract:
- manga_name: a string with the manga title
- manga_chapters: a list of dictionaries, each with keys 'name' (the chapter title e.g. "Chapter 1") and 'link' (the absolute or relative string URL as it appears in the source).

Assumptions and requirements:
- Use the selectolax library for parsing (node is a selectolax.parsers.Node representing the page DOM).
- Return a Python dictionary with keys 'manga_name' and 'manga_chapters'.
- **Chapter Container Identification:**
  - Locate the primary container holding the chapter list. 
  - **Priority Classes:** Check for common manga theme classes such as `listing-chapters_wrap`, `page-content-listing`, `chapter-list`, or `manga-chapters`.
  - **Item Selectors:** Inside the container, identify individual chapter nodes. Look for `li` or `div` elements with classes like `wp-manga-chapter`, `row-content-chapter`, or generic `li` tags if they contain chapter links.
  - The chapter name must follow this format: "Chapter {n}", where n is a number
- **CRITICAL: Exclusion Logic:** You must strictly exclude chapters found in "Latest Updates", "Top 10", "Widgets", or "Sidebars". Ensure your selector is scoped ONLY to the main chapter list container.
- **Sorting & Ordering:** 
  - The HTML may display chapters in descending order (e.g., 100 down to 1). 
  - **Requirement:** The returned list must be in **ASCENDING order** (1, 2, 3...).
  - **Implementation:** You must extract the chapter number (float or integer) from the chapter name string using regex (e.g., extract `10.5` from "Chapter 10.5"). Sort the final list based on these extracted numbers. If numbering is not detected, reverse the list if it appears to be in descending DOM order.
- **Resilience:** The code should try multiple common selectors if the primary ones fail, but prioritize the specific structure commonly associated with `wp-manga-chapter` if found.
- Do not perform I/O beyond parsing the provided node.
- Include imports within the function (e.g. `import re`).
- Don't document the code.

Example expected output:
{
  'manga_name': 'Manga Title',
  'manga_chapters': [
    {'name': 'Chapter 1', 'link': 'https://example.com/manga/chapter-1'},
    {'name': 'Chapter 2', 'link': 'https://example.com/manga/chapter-2'},
    ...
  ]
}

HTML of the node:
`{html}`
