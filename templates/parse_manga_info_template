Task: Implement a function parse_manga_info(node) that accepts a single parameter node of type selectolax.parsers.Node. The function should parse the given node representing this manga page: "{link}" to extract:
- manga_name: a string with the manga title
- manga_chapters: a list of dictionaries, each with keys 'name' (the chapter title with a format "Chapter 1") and 'link' (the absolute URL to the chapter).
Assumptions and requirements:
- Use the selectolax library for parsing (node is a selectolax.parsers.Node representing the page DOM).
- Return a Python dictionary with keys 'manga_name' and 'manga_chapters'.
  - 'manga_name' -> str
  - 'manga_chapters' -> list[{'name': str, 'link': str}]
- Chapters in the list must be in ascending order by chapter number. If chapter numbers are not present, preserve the order as they appear in the page but still attempt to extract a meaningful numeric order when possible.
- If the manga name or any chapter link cannot be determined, don't try to make up things.
- The function should be resilient to minor HTML structure variations.
- Each chapter link must preserved as it is even if it's relative and not an absolute URL.
- Do not perform I/O beyond parsing the provided node; do not rely on external state.
- Include imports withing the function if you use a library (e.g. re)
- Don't document the code.
Example expected output:
{
  'manga_name': 'My Hero Manga',
  'manga_chapters': [
    {'name': 'Chapter 1', 'link': 'https://example.com/manga/chapter-1'},
    {'name': 'Chapter 2', 'link': 'https://example.com/manga/chapter-2'},
    ...
  ]
}

HTML of the node:
