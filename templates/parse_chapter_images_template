Task: Implement a function parse_chapter_images(node) that accepts a single parameter node of type selectolax.parsers.Node. The function should parse the given node representing a manga chapter's page to extract:
- list of the chapter images urls.
Assumptions and requirements:
- Use the selectolax library for parsing (node is a selectolax.parsers.Node representing the page DOM).
- Return a Python list of strings.
- Preserve the order of the images as they appear in the page.
- Each image url must be an absolute URL. If the link on the page is relative, resolve it against the page's base URL (you may assume the page URL is obtainable from node.base_url or provide a robust fallback).
- The function should be resilient to minor HTML structure variations.
- Do not perform I/O beyond parsing the provided node; do not rely on external state.
- Include imports withing the function if you use a library (e.g. re)
- Don't document the code.
Example expected output:
[
    'https://example.com/manga/chapter-1/1.jpg',
    'https://example.com/manga/chapter-1/2.jpg',
    'https://example.com/manga/chapter-1/3.jpg',
    ...
]
HTML of the node:
